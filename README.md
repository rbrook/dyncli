# dyncli
A generic CLI which builds itself dynamically around an existing FastAPI backend endpoints.

This work is based on a [lecture](https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/designing-a-human-friendly-cli-for-api-driven-infrastructure) given by Oliver Rew at EuroPython.

It has been modified to support Typer with its rich CLI environment.
